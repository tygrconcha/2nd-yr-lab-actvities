# 2nd Year Lab Activities

Some of my hands-on labs completed during my 2nd year in **BS Data Science & Analytics, University of Santo Tomas**.

## Project Index

### 1. EDA
| Folder | Focus | Description |
| ------ | ----- | ----------- |
| [**`data_sampling_techniques/`**](./Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis/data_sampling_techniques) | Statistical sampling | Built five Titanic-dataset samples (simple-random, systematic, stratified, single- & two-stage cluster) and visualized how each shifts class balance, age spread, and variable correlations. |
| [**`exploratory_text_analysis/`**](./Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis/exploratory_text_analysis) | NLP & sentiment | Cleaned drug-reviews text, generated word clouds & top-n counts per rating tier, and compared sentiment polarity histograms (TextBlob) across bad/meh/good reviews. |
| [**`network_analysis/`**](./Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis/network_analysis) | Graph analytics | Mapped ingredient–cuisine relationships: bar-charted top 20 ingredients/cuisines and built a cuisine network graph revealing regional & historical culinary clusters. |
| [**`geospatial_analysis.zip`**](./Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis/geospatial_analysis.zip) | GIS & choropleths | Zipped project combining PH region GeoJSON with PSA data to map population change (2000–2015), wages, poverty thresholds & incidence (2018–2021). |

> **Note:** Large data files are zipped or stored via Git LFS to keep the repo lightweight.

## Purpose
To document and showcase my learning progress and hands-on skills for internship applications.

## How to Use
Feel free to explore the folders. Each folder contains a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with explanations and outputs.

## Note
This is an academic archive; some files may reflect early-stage learning and are kept for transparency.
