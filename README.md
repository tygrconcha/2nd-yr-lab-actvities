# 2nd Year Lab Activities

Hands-on labs completed during my 2nd year in **BS Data Science & Analytics, University of Santo Tomas**.

## Project Index

| Folder | Focus | One-Line Highlight |
| ------ | ----- | ------------------ |
| **`data_sampling/`** | Statistical sampling | Built five Titanic-dataset samples (simple-random, systematic, stratified, single- & two-stage cluster) and visualized how each shifts class balance, age spread, and variable correlations. |
| **`text_analysis/`** | NLP & sentiment | Cleaned  drug-reviews text, generated word clouds & top-n counts per rating tier, and compared sentiment polarity histograms (TextBlob) across bad/meh/good reviews. |
| **`network_analysis/`** | Graph analytics | Mapped ingredient–cuisine relationships: bar-charted top 20 ingredients/cuisines and built a cuisine network graph revealing regional & historical culinary clusters. |
| **`geospatial_analysis/`** | GIS & choropleths | Combined PH region GeoJSON with PSA data to map population change (2000–2015), median wages, poverty thresholds & incidence (2018 vs 2021); uncovered Metro Manila migration pull and Luzon–Mindanao wage gaps. |

> **Note:** Large data files (e.g., PSA extracts, GeoJSON) are zipped or stored via Git LFS to keep the repo lightweight.

## Purpose
To document and showcase my learning progress and hands-on skills for internship applications.

## How to Use
Feel free to explore the folders. Each folder contains a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with explanations and outputs.

## Note
This is an academic archive; some files may reflect early-stage learning and are kept for transparency.
